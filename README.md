# Projects
Steven Abrego's class projects/labs for various EE classes at Stanford University


### Summary of Projects:

# EE 356A: Resonant Converters
Designed, simulated, and built a 25W DC-DC Wireless Power Transfer Converter using a Î¦-2 Inverter. The converter was driven at 6.78 MHz and achieved a maximum drain efficiency of 92.66 %.

# EE 153: Power Electronics
Built a cell phone charger using a step-down transformer, a rectifier, and a flyback converter to convert 120V AC from a wall outlet to produce a 5V DC output capable of charging a cell phone.



# EE 118: Introduction to Mechatronics
Designed and built a fully autonomus robot capable of navigating a predetermined course using an Arduino microcontroller.
