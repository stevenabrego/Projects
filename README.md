Steven Abrego's class projects/labs for various EE classes at Stanford University


### Summary of Projects:

# EE 114: Fundamentals of Analog Integrated Circuit Design 
Designed a three-stage transimpedance amplifier at the transistor-level. Was able to meet all required specifications (< 2mW Power Dissipation, 70 MHz bandwidth, > 40,000 Gain) with given node technology.



EE 118 - Designed and built a fully autonomus robot capable of navigating a predetermined course using an Arduino microcontroller.



EE 157 - Designed and built (3D-printed) an axial-flux 3-phase permanent magnet motor capable of 4000+ rpm.
