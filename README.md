# Projects
Steven Abrego's class projects/labs for various EE classes at Stanford University


### Summary of Projects:

# EE 356A: Resonanrt Converters
Designed and built a 25W DC-DC Wireless Power Transfer Converter using a \Phi-2 Inverter

# EE 114: Fundamentals of Analog Integrated Circuit Design 
Designed a three-stage transimpedance amplifier at the transistor-level. Was able to meet all required specifications (< 2mW Power Dissipation, 70 MHz bandwidth, > 40,000 Gain) with given node technology.



# EE 118: Introduction to Mechatronics
Designed and built a fully autonomus robot capable of navigating a predetermined course using an Arduino microcontroller.



# EE 157: Electric Motors for Renewable Energy, Robotics, and Electric Vehicles
Designed and built (3D-printed) an axial-flux 3-phase permanent magnet motor capable of 4000+ rpm.
